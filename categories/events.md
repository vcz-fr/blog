_Alone, you may go fast but it is together that we go far._ Events represent the opportunity to exchange ideas and to grow
in a fast-paced environment. In a modern world where we drown in information and where fear of missing out is ever so present, choosing or helping peers deciding on the best path is needed salvation.

Articles about events will relay the event experience through a written channel and artifacts such as pictures. The hope
for these articles is that they entice readers to reach out to event organizers to participate to their next instances
as an attendee, a speaker or an event helper!
