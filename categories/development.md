Year after year, new ideas emerge and concepts become increasingly abstract. Navigating the troubled waters of
development is paradoxically simpler and difficult at the same time. New paradigms, technologies and tools enrich the
experience yet at the same time the subject of the matter, i.e. the actual code that is executed, is hidden behind
new layers.
The articles that lie within this category may not be taken at face value but rather reflected on. They may contain

ideas that you might find worthwhile. As with anything, this fiels is highly subjective; there are countless ways to
reach the same result. Our quest is to find the best one, which is as abstract a notion.
