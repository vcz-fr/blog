## The program

As an organization, possessing an AWS Competency means being able to prove your expertise in a specific field. It means
becoming a partner of choice for companies that would like to rely on AWS to meet their expectations. It means showing
creativity in solving the most complex problems, those for which there is no answer yet. It means being officially
recognized by AWS for these reasons, standing out and moving the industry forward.

The [official program page](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/){:rel="nofollow"} lists all of these
distinctions. The application process requires preparation and an extensive knowledge of the issues in the field they
concern. They can be focused on a particular industry, technology area or platform.

Today, two AWS Competencies have been added to the Industries list: [Public Safety and Disaster Response](https://aws.amazon.com/stateandlocal/justice-and-public-safety/partner-solutions/){:rel="nofollow"}
and [Retail](https://aws.amazon.com/retail/partner-solutions/){:rel="nofollow"}.

## Public safety and Disaster response

It is difficult to predict with certainty the occurrence and magnitude of natural and man-made disasters. In order to
minimize the impact of these events, Public Safety and Disaster Response Competency partners are able to offer solutions
to raise public awareness, anticipate disasters, prepare for response and respond quickly and resiliently during times
when every second is precious.

Among the challenges that may be faced is the operation of critical information systems opening channels with
disaster-prone communities to facilitate response, even in the event that any standard means of communication is
degraded or non-functional.

## Retail

Faced with a booming market and increasingly demanding customers, retail is in a constant state of evolution to offer an
ever richer and personalized experience. Where the majority of users of an e-commerce website or a traditional retail
outlet sees the product catalogue, there is a whole ecosystem of tools, processes and know-how in the back office that
runs parallel to the business, before, during and after any order.

Each of these areas contributes to the final experience and requires special attention. These areas include logistics,
payment systems, inventory management, planning, analysis and all the functions that accompany and augment all the
others.

AWS offers two ways of applying for the Retail Competency. The scope of this business area is such that there are a
multitude of internationally recognized solutions that participate in the retail ecosystem. This is referred to as a
Technology Partnership. Knowing these solutions and being able to successfully implement and increment them to provide a
more complete view of one of the main areas of retail makes it possible to qualify for the second option: the Consulting
Partnership.
