    <h2>The blogging craze had me too</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, Vincenzo <b>Scalzi</b> here!
    </p>
    <p>
        What if we could do better? How can learn better from our and everyone else's mistakes? It is high time to
        explore the blogging universe and to contribute my own ideas into the mix. This blog comes in addition to my
        <a href="https://twitter.com/vcz_fr" rel="nofollow">Twitter feed</a> which contains my curated selection of news
        and ideas to explore.
        <br>
        Where does this wish to blog came from? Like anyone else, I have ideas. I wish to share mine in the hope to
        produce the spark that will lead you to greater ideas. Similarly, I wish for you to help your community so that
        our paths may cross one day.
    </p>
    <p>
        As for this site, like my others, it is open source, hosted on
        <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="nofollow">GitHub Pages</a>, uses
        <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" rel="nofollow">Jekyll</a> to generate content and is delivered to you by
        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="nofollow">Cloudflare</a>.
        <br>
        That way, there is no server to manage, no hosting costs or headaches, just a domain. Just a domain with content
        you will appreciate. I can only hope you will like it, as I will never add any third party comment tool or
        analytics. If you do enjoy the contents, come by
        <a href="https://github.com/vcz-fr/blog" rel="nofollow">the place that hosts it</a> and leave your mark. Or
        check out my <a href="https://vcz.fr">personal website</a>, my <a href="https://meetups.vcz.fr">Meetup notes</a>
        or my <a href="https://meetups.vcz.fr">apps</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not forget to <a href="https://apps.vcz.fr/feedback/?appid=DW7RbJ8FWHm5">leave some feedback</a> so that I can make your experience better.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have a nice visit!
